How does nesting the <a> tag inside the <p> tag affect the display of the text?


    The text within the <a> tag will be styled as a hyperlink (typically underlined and colored blue by default)
  
  Example : <p>This is a paragraph with an <a href="https://example.com">inline link</a> inside it.</p>






What happens if you move the <a> tag outside the <p> tag?


     This allows the entire paragraph to function as a clickable link.


   Example : <a href="https:example.com"> <p>This entire paragraph is a clickable link.</p>
</a>
